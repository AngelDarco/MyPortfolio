<ul>
    <li> Hello, my name is Angel, I am 29 years old, and I'm from Peru.</li>  
    <li>I met the world of computing, at 12 years old, since then, I could never leave it. </li> 
    <li>Like any young person who starts in this beautiful world, I took my first steps in the world of hacking.</li>
    <li> The more I knew, the more problems I got into, so I started with design, editing and 3d modeling, but knowing how to use programs did not make me very happy, since I always wanted to be the one who creates the programs and not the one who pays to use them. </li>
    <li> This led me to the world of programming, I took my first steps with Java, C# and Python.
        But Javascript was the language that captivated me, due to its extensive architecture, frameworks, the other languages with which it complements itself, the large number of projects you can create, and the large community it has, and with which you can learn, teach and compete.
    </li>
    <li>I have never thought of coding for money, more than 50 hours per week and it's always for fun, I don't have a degree either, I dropped out of university because I felt they were wasting my time, teaching me things that I wasn't intersted, but I never stop to learn for myself.</li>
    <li>Finally, if you need help with a project or homework, feel free to contact me, don't worry, I do it for free, just give me some real challenges.</li>
